## I do computer stuff for a living. I also try to become a teacher!

- During 2020 my goal was to become a full stack developer, at least as a hobby. It went as expected.
- I would love to collaborate with other developers, but am a bit too shy to approach people.
- I am currently learning JS (again), R & Rust.
- You can reach me on [Discord][discord_profile] and [Telegram][telegram].
- You could also write me an [email][email], if you like it a bit more oldschool ([PGP][PGP]).
- Beside all that my big hobby is gaming, online and offline. Oh, and cooking!
